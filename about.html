        <p>
          I'm a fourth year information and communication technology engineering student from Tampere. My main intress is on
          modern web software deveploment and DevOps technologies.
        </p>
        <p> 
          On my studies I've gotten strong background of Java programming and everything else is build around it. As I've progressed my 
          focus have been shifted towards web software deveploment. As I went through <a href="https://fullstackopen.com/en/"> Full Stack Open</a> 
          I got myself familiarized with things like React, React Native, Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, GraphQL and TypeScript. I will continue work on my 
          web deveploment skills as I find it to be a lot of fun and rewarding. Lately I've introduced myself into DevOps -world as I've learned basics 
          of Docker & Kubernetes. I like to challenge myself and that is what DevOps -stuff have been giving to me but step by step I'm getting more hooked 
          into it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides programming I spend my free time mostly enjoying nature and playing & watching sports. I do fishing all year around and I haven't yet found 
          better meal than self-catched & cooked fish. Most of my life I played football but nowdays I challenge myself in a gym several times in a week. Football 
          is a still big part of my life as I enjoy to watch games from "Sunday League" to Premier League.
